Germanium, a metalloid, has some effects and health risks by itself and when in water. Germanium has both inorganic and organic forms. While the former is widely used in the electronics industry, the latter was originally incorporated into supplements during the 1970’s for its widely acclaimed ability to “induce erythropoietic, antimicrobial, antiviral, antimutagenic, antitumor, and immunomodulating effects”. Even today, one can find germanium-containing dietary supplements in health stores. However, little is known about its long-term effects on human health and the environmental health. A study found, however, that small amounts of germanium have seeped into rivers and other water systems through the natural water flow and from sewers, though again, the impact on the environment is not fully known, albeit various studies are working to figure that out.
