2-methoxyethanol is a part of the ethylene glycol ethers family and is a highly reactive, colorless liquid at room temperature. 2-methoxyethanol is used as a solvent for the manufacturing of a variety of products including lacquers, metal coating, epoxy resin coating, brake fluids, inks and dyes, etc. This contaminant also has the potential for skin absorption which can contribute to blood, kidney, liver, and central nervous system toxicity. While exposure to this chemical can cause adverse reproductive effects in animals, the same has not be proven for humans (ie. exposure to the chemical is not clinically proven to affect human reproduction).{1}
