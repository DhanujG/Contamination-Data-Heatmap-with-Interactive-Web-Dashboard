Testosterone is a hormone produced by the human body. It's mainly produced in men by the testicles. Testosterone affects a man's appearance and sexual development. It stimulates sperm production as well as a man's sex drive. It also helps build muscle and bone mass.{1} Currently, testosterone can be found at low amounts in some drinking water supplies, however there is not enough research on the existence of its negative side effects and there are no regulatory guidelines in place.{2}
