NDMA is an N-nitrosamine, a type of compound that has the generic chemical structure R2Nâ€“N=O, a deprotonated amine bonded to a nitroso group. N-nitrosamines are generally formed when a secondary or tertiary amine reacts with a nitrosating agent. The compounds are found at low levels in many foods, such as roasted meats, cheese, and beer, because of cooking and fermentation processes.{1} Exposure to high levels of NDMA may cause liver damage in humans.{2}
