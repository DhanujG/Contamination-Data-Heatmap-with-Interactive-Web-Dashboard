Chromium, a transition metal, poses significant threats to the environment and human health, especially when it is in the form of hexavalent chromium (Chromium-6), It is estimated that approximately 200 million Americans from all states have experienced higher-than-normal levels of Chromium-6 in their drinking water at some point. The current federal standard for total Chromium in drinking water is 100 ppb or less. However, this number is constantly being reevaluated as new information is released regarding the detrimental effects of excess Chromium on the human body. Speaking of detrimental effects, the most significant one is that Chromium is an oxidizing agent, pulling electrons from various biological molecules in the body and wreaking havoc for the bodyâ€™s natural electrochemical balance. In addition, Chromium-6 is also known to be carcinogenic. The chemical has also been connected to liver damage, reproductive problems and developmental harm, according to the EWG, and presents greater risks to infants and children, people who take antacids, and people with poorly functioning livers. The interesting thing about Chromium is that trivalent Chromium (Chromium-3) is a form of the element that is actually an essential dietary nutrient. All the difference that seemingly slight changes in chemical structure can make!
