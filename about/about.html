                        <u>What I worked on:</u>
                            <p>In the beginning, I worked on a website mock up, that we edited gradually, so that we had an idea of how the website would look like in the end. Overall, I mainly worked on html and css for the about page.</p>
                        <u>What I'm interested in:</u>
                            <p>I'm interested in how technology plays a role in current and future efforts of sustainability, and how data can be easier displayed to be more accessible to the general public. Outside of EcoData, I'm apart of The Pantanal Partnership, where we work to find solutions and provide support to the indigenous peoples of The Pantanal in Brazil, and I'm a member of Climate Blue, which focuses on sending UM delegates to the UN conference of parties and currently is working on developing a network of universities to share ideas, information, and progress towards carbon neutral campuses.</p>

                            <p>My portion of this project mainly consisted of implementing the heatmap's functionality, namely taking the csv data files and generating an interactive heatmap in the browser out of them.</p>
                        <u>What I'm interested in:</u>
                            <p>I'm interested in building tools to help people quickly and easily learn about environmental issues, so they can be better informed about the world around them.</p>
