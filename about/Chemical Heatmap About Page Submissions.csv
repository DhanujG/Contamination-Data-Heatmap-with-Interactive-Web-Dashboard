Overall, I mainly worked on html and css for the about page.","I'm interested in how technology plays a role in current and future efforts of sustainability, and how data can be easier displayed to be more accessible to the general public. Outside of EcoData, I'm apart of The Pantanal Partnership, where we work to find solutions and provide support to the indigenous peoples of The Pantanal in Brazil, and I'm a member of Climate Blue, which focuses on sending UM delegates to the UN conference of parties and currently is working on developing a network of universities to share ideas, information, and progress towards carbon neutral campuses."
