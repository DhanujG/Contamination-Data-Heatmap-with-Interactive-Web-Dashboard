While the EPA provides the data for contamination sites and dates for the state of Michigan, the dataset contains hundreds of data points and is difficult to determine the impactful data. To alleviate this issue, we first used Python, through libraries such as Pandas and NumPy, to gather, analyze, and organize the EPA data into structured csv (spreadsheet-ish) files.

Afterwards, the Matplotlib library was used to generate chemical heatmap images from the csv files. The heatmap images generated from this process were a significant step up from the raw EPA data, and made it very easy to look at the image and immediately see which parts of Michigan each chemical in the data was most prevalent in. 

Next, we wanted to make it simple and easy for the average Michigander, who lacks the expertise to use a terminal and run several python scripts, to easily view similar, but more interactive, heatmaps from the comfort of their browser. To accomplish this, we first used Node.js to convert our csv data files into JSON. While csv files are useful for data analysis, JSON is the "lingua-franca" of the web, a far superior file format for sending and storing data on the web.

Next, we built a website, which you can check out at https://dhanujg.github.io/chem_heatmap.github.io/.
